               Summary:
               <br>
               Sakusa Kiyoomi is a highly intelligent, capable, professional adult man who plays for one of the best adult volleyball teams in the nation. He intimidates his opponents greatly on the court and is a true force to be reckoned with.
               <br>
               <br>
               But public bathrooms are his #1 enemy.
               <br>

               He may not despise them all as much as he did in high school, but a dirty public bathroom is still something he wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole.
               <br>
               <br>
               Well, at least his boyfriend Atsumu's there to help him make slightly less of a fool of himself.

               Work Text:
               <br>
               Sakusa can barely hear Atsumu's unending rambling over the sound of his own mind screaming at him—the screams specifically pertaining to the mass of liquid currently settled in his bladder. Thank God he wears masks, because he isn't sure he'd be able to keep his immense discomfort from showing on his face if he wasn't.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               They still have an almost 25-minute walk to the train station they need to be at to catch their ride home seeing as they'd just left the restaurant they were visiting at the opposite side of Osaka. The place is fairly new and was said to have pretty good food by a few friends of theirs, so the two men figured that they would visit it for their bi-weekly date day. The food was delicious, much to their delight, but now the younger of the two is somewhat regretting having made the trip across the city for it—or, at least without first being more mindful about handling his physical needs.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               The ravenette grimaces behind his mask as a shiver runs down his spine following a particularly strong jolt that hits his bladder, his thighs reflexively tensing up before being forced to separate once again for him to take his next step. His pupils nervously dart down to his boyfriend's face to verify that he hadn't seen the man's seemingly random shudder, re-focusing his gaze on the pathway in front of them a half second later.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               If there's anything he doesn't want or need right now, it's Atsumu butting in about his need to piss and forcing him to find some vile public bathroom to go and relieve himself in. In fact, that's precisely why he's in this predicament now.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               He'd actually gotten up at the restaurant about halfway through their meal to go take a piss when his urge had been slightly less of an annoyance, but all he needed was to catch a glimpse of that bathroom through the slowly-closing door as another customer had been exiting to decide that there was no way in hell that he was going in there. The trashcan overflowing with used paper towels and a puddle of something he hoped to God was water on the floor in front of the sinks told him all he'd needed to know. It was clear that it hadn't been cleaned, at the very LEAST, all day—though, honestly, who knows how long it'd actually been. Instead of risking his health to whatever diseases awaited him in that god forsaken space, he'd just stood around the area for a while, stalling for time to keep Atsumu from realizing that he hadn't actually gone before heading back to their table and sitting down, forcing himself to appear relaxed as if he actually had just taken care of his business.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               It's times like this that Kiyoomi absolutely despises his germaphobic tendencies. Sure, he very much prefers being clean, safe, and healthy to simply just assuming everywhere he goes is clean enough to not give him some horrible sickness, but he also could've avoided this entirely if he weren't so intensely conscious of the cleanliness of his surroundings all the time. It's as annoying as it is gratifying.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Regardless, he deeply inhales and exhales as quietly as he can manage, trying his best to tune back into what the box-blonde had been saying.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "—So anyways, I really do think that squid is a MILLION times better tasting than octopus. I've lived by that my entire life, but stupid 'Samu always tries to tell me that I'm wrong. What do ya' think Omi-Omi?" Atsumu turns his head to look up at Sakusa, who—once again—only briefly meets his gaze.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "I really don't know Tsum-Tsum. I'm honestly pretty impartial." Kiyoomi tries to ignore the way his bladder contracts as he takes a bit of focus away from holding to rejoin the conversation, but it'd honestly startled him a little. Every jolt, spasm, and contraction feels just that much more intense than the last, and it's honestly beginning to get a little alarming... Why the hell is his bladder filling so damn quickly? Sure, he'd had two cups of tea with his food at the restaurant, but they shouldn't be going through him this quickly. Should they?...
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Atsumu shoots him a playfully pouty glare, playfully hooking his arm around Sakusa's and huffing. "No Omi! Ya' have to pick one! Obviously, there's only one right answer, but I'll let ya' say it on yer own." He smiles, staring up at him impatiently.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Sakusa glances down at him again, sighing and rolling his eyes at the man's childishness—even though it does still make his heart flutter as always. This boy and his adorable pout.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               The next contraction of his bladder catches him off guard with it's sudden intensity—so much so, in fact, that he makes the mistake of hissing through his teeth upon feeling it, very subtly bending forward at the hips and rocking back into the upright walking position he'd been in previously to try and take some of the brief pressure off of his bladder.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Unsurprisingly, Atsumu does catch this, his eyebrows raising in surprise at the unexpected action. "What was that about? Ya' alright Omi-Omi?"
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Sakusa nods—almost a little too quickly—in response, keeping his gaze set anywhere but on his boyfriend's confused face.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "Ya' sure? Does something hurt?" The blonde eyes him up and down, re-focusing on his face afterwards when he doesn't notice any visible oddities.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "Nope. Just felt a weird feeling in my stomach for a second. I'm fine." He tenses his thighs slightly again as another wave of need hits his bladder. God— can Atsumu stop looking at him for a moment? He needs to squirm or something to shake this urge off...
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "...Why don't I believe ya'..." Atsumu narrows his eyes, shooting the ravenette a skeptical frown and continuing to stare at him. Something about this situation is...familiar. Where has he seen this before?...
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Sakusa, with all the subtly he can muster, snakes his hand into the pocket of his jeans, gently applying pressure to his crotch in hopes of tricking his mind into relieving some of the pressure in his bladder for the moment. This is dangerous. Not only is his state worsening pretty rapidly at this point, but he can't do anything to stave off what is teetering on the edge of desperation by this point with his overly-attentive-ass-boyfriend Atsumu standing directly beside him. Something tells him that this is about to take a turn very soon—and probably for the worse. But he can't let his predicament be found out, and he DEFINITELY can't lose to it. Both options would be wildly humiliating, but—even worse—the second option is too utterly disgusting to even imagine.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "I don't know, cause you're stupid?" He spits out before wincing at the sound of the high school Kiyoomi-esque insult that just left his mouth, immediately feeling bad for unintentionally resorting to his defense mechanism of just being plain assholeish.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Before the blonde even has a chance to react to the response, he speaks out again, moving his pocketed hand to apply even more pressure to himself as yet another contraction hits his bladder. "—Sorry. I didn't mean that. I just— I'm fine, alright? I'm just ready to get back to the station and head home. Just tired of walking I guess."
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Atsumu silently eyes him for another couple seconds, not believing even a second of that bullshit. Sakusa's pretty much always tired of or from something, but it never causes him to react like that. Sighing softly, he shakes his head and shrugs, facing forward again.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "Alright Omi, if ya' say so." He simply takes the man's free hand into his own, quietly continuing to walk alongside him. His eyes flicker over toward the ravenette's form every so often, just trying to catch him in the act again. He knows there's something up. He's fully aware of how stubborn his boyfriend is cause—well—he has known him since highschool, after all. It's only natural that he's pretty well-versed in his knowledge of the man's tendencies. So, it isn't hard for him to figure out that his normally quite stoic boyfriend either just doesn't want to deal with whatever the issue is, doesn't care enough, or is too embarrassed to say something.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Atsumu pulls his phone out of his pocket, subtly glancing down at it to check the time before stuffing it back in and looking back up. They have maybe another 15 minutes of walking before they get to the station, so if the ravenette really is just tired, his problem will be over pretty soon. But the blonde just....doesn't believe that's true.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               ———
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               True to Atsumu's estimation, they arrive at the station's entrance about 15 minutes later, and Sakusa is.... Well. He's holding on.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               The hand that was in his pocket before that he'd been using to partially hold himself is now down at his side because his boyfriend had almost caught him doing it on their way. He shrugged it off as just him keeping his hand in his pocket, but lost his only source of even moderate relief. Since then, it'd taken everything in his power not to fidget and squirm as they walk, his now-free hand itching to return to his pocket and the hand interlocked with Atsumu's repeatedly clenching every few moments.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               He's definitely crossed the threshold of desperation by now, and with his bladder still filling at a fast pace and his muscles being the only thing he can use right now to keep the liquid at bay, He's nearing the point of no return WAY faster than he can handle. It was already bad at the restaurant. It was worse when they'd started walking. And now, all he knows is that he needs to find a station bathroom before things really get embarrassing. It barely even matters to him what condition it's in now, he'll just....have to suck it up. Though, knowing himself, he might not be able to do that depending on how bad it is. He can hardly even tolerate a clean public bathroom.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               The two of them walk into the station terminal they'd been assigned and Sakusa immediately begins scanning the area for a bathroom or the sign for one, his head and eyes moving a little more snappily than normal. But, hey, he's kind of in a hurry here—to say the least.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               His chest swells with relief—not quite the same kind that he wants right at this moment, but any relief is good relief to him right now at the same time—as he spots the much-anticipated men's bathroom sign he'd been searching for, a somewhat shuddery rush of breath leaving his throat. As they get closer to the boarding area, and, subsequently, the bathroom, Sakusa spots something that makes his blood run cold and his heart plummet into his stomach all over again.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Out of order.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Out of fucking order.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               The man feels his eye twitch with irritation as he stands there, unable to believe what the fuck he's seeing right now. This...this is a joke, right? As if rubbing salt into the wound and chasing it with a shot of lemon juice, the gradually-increasing rumble of the train echoes through the terminal as it approaches them. Oh, how fucking lovely. Now he can't even try to go and look for another bathroom.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Atsumu smiles, humming out of pleasant surprise and affectionately squeezing his boyfriend's hand a few times. "Look at that! We made it right on time, Omi. How lucky."
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Yeah. Lucky. That's exactly how he'd describe this situation. Lucky for who, exactly?
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "Yeah." Kiyoomi breathes, shifting his hips from side to side as casually and subtly as he can before settling back down. This whole situation is starting to piss him off—though maybe that's just because of the desperation. Anger seems to be the only emotion he can manage without really thinking about it in situations like this.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Atsumu looks up at him again, quirking an eyebrow at his breathy tone. He almost sounds....strained? And, despite the mask covering the lower half of the man's face, the blonde can still very much see the way his boyfriend's eyebrows are twitching, seemingly trying to fight against something or other. He knows he won't get an honest answer if he mentions it, so he just decides to keep quiet, sighing softly and pulling his boyfriend through the opened train doors.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               The ravenette's heart hammers in his chest as they take their seats, the fear and slight panic really beginning to set in once the doors close. Realistically, they only have about 30 minutes before they get back home, but Kiyoomi isn't sure whether or not he'll be able to hold it for that long—at least not without giving his issue away to Atsumu. Though, being honest with himself, the man either probably already knows what's wrong with him, or has a vague idea about it. It's pretty hard to be discreet and unassuming when you're randomly breathing a little-too-hard and consistently clenching your hand around your boyfriend's own appendage.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               It's only 30 minutes. 30 minutes is nothing. He can do this. He is Sakusa fucking Kiyoomi, one of the top volleyball spikers in the country. He will not be pissing himself on a train as a fully grown adult—and especially not while sat next to his boyfriend. He's not a child that needs to take an "emergency potty break" or something. He's perfectly capable of making it to a bathroom.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               He gasps suddenly as his bladder spasms, his leg shooting up to cross over the other at the thighs and his hands gripping desperately at the hem of his shirt.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               God he hopes he won't be eating those words in a moment.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               ———
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "Cmon Omi-Omi! I've got 'ya. Just take it one step at a time." Atsumu holds onto Sakusa's arm, cautiously guiding him off of the train and toward the train station's exit. They'd finally made it back after the promised 30 minutes, but Atsumu's boyfriend is hanging on by one very unstable thread.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               It didn't take very long at all for the ravenette to become unable to hide his desperation about 10 minutes into the ride, because tightly crossed legs and soft grunts just weren't cutting it anymore. At one point, he'd been hit with a wave so bad that he practically folded in on himself, thighs trembling and hands gripping his crotch for dear life as all the piss he'd been holding in for the past several hours tried to force its way out. Understandably, Atsumu initially freaked out, thinking something was really terribly wrong with his Omi with the noises he was making and actions he was displaying.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               But, once Sakusa shot him a strained 'Shut up you idiot—' through gritted teeth and began fanning his legs open and closed, he'd finally realized what the real problem was. Of course. THAT'S why his mannerisms seemed so familiar, Kiyoomi used to have much more of a vendetta against public restrooms when they were in high school and significantly less control over his body, so he ended up in desperate situations like these more frequently than he most likely should've. It hasn't happened nearly as much since he'd gotten older, but old habits die hard, as they say. Though really, after his boyfriend explained to him why he'd been forced to wait to this point of need, this time it seems as if it was less so about his own stubbornness and more so about unfortunate circumstances.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               So, here he is, leading a shuffling, slightly-hunched-over Kiyoomi down the path to this station's bathroom, his nerves growing with each pant, gasp, and quiet grunt the man lets out. Sakusa no longer has essentially any regard toward whether or not people can see him and his desperation in this moment. All he's focused on is not giving them a reason to stare at him even harder as he makes his way through the terminal, one hand seemingly permanently glued to his groin. Sakusa is forced to suddenly stop and twist his legs around each other as his overfilled, abused organ gives two angry spasms, threatening to spill the first leak into his boxers. He groans, his breath uneven and shaky as he bends forward at the hips and grips at his pant leg with his free hand.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Atsumu quietly swears under his breath, hurriedly looking around for the bathroom sign before spotting it up on the top of a wall corner leading into the hallway just before the exit. The blonde perks up slightly, gasping and placing a hand on Sakusa's back.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "Omi! The bathroom is over here! Yer' almost there, I promise. Grab yer' junk and hold on, all ya' need is just a few more steps." He gently pats his boyfriend's back, waiting until he slowly stretches back into an upright position before beginning to lead him to the hallway as quickly as the other man can manage to go.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Sakusa grips himself as hard as he can, practically hobbling with trepidation as they head up to the bathroom sign and round the corner.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               And, all at once, everything comes crashing down around the ravenette as he nearly lets out a sob then and there.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "Fuck!" Atsumu exclaims as his eyes land upon the short line protruding out from the door of the single-use bathroom. This train station is considerably smaller than the one they'd just come from, meaning that the bathroom here is also considerably smaller. The line isn't too terribly long, only four or five people standing in it. But, unfortunately, that's four or five people too many for Sakusa to handle—said man attaching his other hand to his crotch where his first hand still remains. It's all he can do to keep from pissing all over the floor right then and there, his bladder not at all appreciating having the prospect of imminent relief being ripped out of its waiting clutches as it had. This is humilating. So humiliating. Kiyoomi can only be more thankful for his mask hiding the majority of the furious crimson blush staining his cheeks and face right now. He's already embarrassed enough.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               The other men in the line eye Sakusa with concern and sympathy as they watch him very clearly struggling to keep it together where he stands.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               One speaks up, offering the man a kind smile and an empathetic glint in his eyes. "Hey man, you wanna cut in front of me? You seem like you need to go way more than I do."
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Sakusa, with everything he can muster without taking any focus away from preventing the dam from breaking, gently shakes his head. "No th—thanks."
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Atsumu gapes at him, face twisting up into a confused gawk of an expression. "HUH? BUT OMI Y—"
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "L-Let's go 'Tsumu." Sakusa grits out, taking the opportunity of his very brief pause in the immense pressure battering his bladder to continue shuffling forward, rushing forward at the fastest pace he can currently go toward the exit.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Atsumu, absolutely stunned and bewildered, simply follows after him, jogging to catch up with him after he gets slightly ahead. He looks at Sakusa like the man is absolutely insane, immediately having assumed that he'd just passed up that opportunity out of disgust for the bathroom. "Omi! Why the hell did ya' say NO to that?! Ya' look like yer' about to pop!"
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Kiyoomi pants and grunts with effort as the wave of desperation returns, his pace slowing back down to a hobble as he continues to make a beeline for the exit. "I-I can't— I-I wouldn't've been able to- ngh— h-hold it for long enough. I would've wet myself right there in that—" He lets out another gasp, voice quivering and muscles working overtime. "—t-that line. Fuck 'T-'Tsumu— I can't hold it any longer. I-I need to— f-fucking hell."
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Atsumu watches as his boyfriend, the ever so apathetic and calm Sakusa Kiyoomi, sits on the brink of tears from his sheer bursting need to piss. The blonde's mouth gapes open as he watches the display in front of him of Sakusa writhing in desperation, beads of sweat dripping down his forehead and soaking into the top of his mask.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Suddenly, Kiyoomi comes to a complete and total stop, freezing up completely in the middle of the sidewalk with eyes wide as saucers.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               "Atsumu—" He breathes, his gaze not leaving a fixated spot on the concrete. "—A-Atsumu, I'm peeing. I can't stop it."
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               The man's statement is verified by the sound of bursts of hissing ringing out into the air, causing the blonde to gasp and swear yet again. As quickly as he can, Atsumu grabs his boyfriend's arm, yanking him toward and into the closest alleyway and shoving him just behind the cover of a large dumpster.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Sakusa would be absolutely horrified by being back here if he wasn't completely and totally overwhelmed with euphoria as his muscles finally completely give out beneath him. He leans forward, bending at the knees and hands tightly gripping the front of Atsumu's jacket for stability as liquid streams down his legs and pours from the front of his pants almost like the spout of a faucet. The—mostly clear—piss splatters loudly against the asphalt ground, seeping into cracks and puddling under his and Atsumu's feet.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Kiyoomi practically shakes as he pants from the intensity of his release, barely even able to keep his moans of satisfaction back. He forces himself to do so, however, out of the simple desire to preserve at least some amount of his dignity. Through the cloudy haze of his relief-flooded mind, the ringing thoughts about how utterly repulsively gross this is sit looming in his brain. He can't believe he let something like this happen to him. Him of all people. He had a perfectly fine opportunity to go at multiple points earlier, and here he is now, pissing himself in a filthy alleyway behind a dumpster as his boyfriend of four years watches. Disgusting.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Finally, after what was far too long of a minute for Sakusa's liking, the blasting stream pouring through his jeans begins to taper off, slowing to a trickle after a few seconds. Kiyoomi stands there, still trembling for a moment, before slowly releasing his grip on his boyfriend, silently stretching back out and avoiding any and all eye contact the blonde may be trying to make with him.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Said blonde places a hand on his shoulder, still looking up at his face despite the man's obvious refusal to even look at him. The empathetic expression on Atsumu's face is one not often seen, even to Kiyoomi, but now is definitely one of the times for it. He thinks about saying something, but, knowing his boyfriend, anything he could say right now would only mortify him further. So, he opts to say nothing, simply offering him a pat on the shoulder and a small pack of travel wet-wipes from his jacket pocket that he carries around all the time—specifically knowing his boyfriend's habits. Sakusa takes the wipes with a humiliated nod of thanks, tearing the packet open and thoroughly wiping down his hands and arms.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Tossing the wipes and packet into the dumpster beside them, Kiyoomi wordlessly begins making his way out of the alley, Atsumu walking right beside him and intertwining his fingers with Sakusa's. The man doesn't react at first, just staring at the ground in silence and thick embarrassment, somewhat surprised that his boyfriend wants to be anywhere near him right now after that. Eventually, though, he returns the interlocking of his fingers, holding the blonde's hand tightly as they make their way back to their shared apartment.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Well, he now knows two things:
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Atsumu's the best boyfriend he could've ever asked for, and he is 100% getting a bathroom tracking app on his phone.
